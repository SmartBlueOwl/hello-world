Getting started on GitHub Tutorial

Hi Guys!

Genevieve here, I'm new at this and can't wait to learn more. I hope I'm taking the right path toward the Virtual World of Photography, Design and anything worth watching for.
By the way I'm a Mermaid, that happends to like to shapeshift into a Blue Owl.
